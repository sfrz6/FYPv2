Smart Honeypot Threat Intelligence Dashboard

This project is a custom threat-intelligence dashboard designed to visualize and analyze attacks collected from multiple honeypot sensors, including Cowrie, Dionaea, and OpenCanary. Each sensor runs on its own VM and produces raw logs, which are later cleaned, enriched, and converted into NDJSON files using custom Python parsers. These parsers remove irrelevant events, classify attack types, assign unique attack IDs, and enrich every entry with GeoIP and AbuseIPDB information. Private IPs used for lab testing are automatically labeled as originating from Muscat, Oman to keep the data consistent.

The dashboard does not rely on a backend or API. Instead, it directly reads the NDJSON files stored inside the project folder and updates the interface automatically using JavaScript’s setInterval function. This allows the dashboard to refresh every few seconds without requiring the user to reload the page, making it lightweight, responsive, and easy to deploy on any machine.

The interface provides an overview of recent attacks, global attack distribution, top statistics, and a dedicated attack map that shows the geographic origin of each event, including a special green marker for private IPs mapped to Oman. The advanced search bar allows filtering by sensor, country, attack type, time, or keyword, giving the user SIEM-style control while keeping the design simple. When an attack is selected, the details page presents the full storyline, including login attempts, commands, timestamps, and enrichment data.

This setup makes the dashboard ideal for research, education, and small SOC environments that want a clear, self-contained honeypot monitoring tool with no external dependencies. Simply place your NDJSON files in the project directory, open the dashboard in a browser, and it begins working immediately.
